# advent_of_code_2023

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, written in Ruby.

## Structure

Each day's challenge has its own directory. Inside each directory, you will find:
- A Ruby script with the solution (e.g., `day01.rb`).
- The input data for the challenge (`input.txt`).
- Specs will be in their day folder

## Days

- **Day 01**: 
- **Day 02**: 


## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the day's directory and run the Ruby script. For example:

```bash
cd day01
ruby day01.rb
